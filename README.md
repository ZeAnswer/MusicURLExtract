# MusicURLExtract (Java)
A simple tool I made to find and organize spotify/youtube URLS from WhatsApp Chat exports

Instructions:
Assuming "src" is the project's root
- place wanted text files in the ./TextSources folder
- if you want to find different URL formats, edit the array in the file src/URLchecker.java
- run main

output file should then be at ./OutputFiles
